# Breif Analysis and Conclusion from the Dataset
1. Sales Overview Report

The report analyzes Giant bike company's sales from 2010 to 2014, totaling RM 109.81 million. Sales peaked in 2013 at RM 52.28 million. A map graph indicates the company's strongest market is in the southwest United States, followed by Canada. A doughnut chart shows that road and mountain bikes dominate sales, making up nearly 40% of total revenue. A pie chart highlights black, red, and silver as the most popular bike colors among customers.

Overall, Giant should continue focusing on their best-selling bike types—road and mountain bikes—and consider expanding into new, high-quality bike components. With black, red, and silver proving most popular, introducing similar shades like grey could enhance appeal. Using color effectively may significantly boost brand recognition, attractiveness, and influence customer purchasing decisions.

2. Order report

This order report examines the relationship between order quantity and other related attributes. From 2010 to 2014, a total of 274.78K orders were placed, with bikes and clothing accounting for the majority—highlighting them as the company’s core products.

The line graph reveals a sharp rise in reseller orders from 2010 to 2013, followed by a complete drop in 2014. Internet sales followed a similar trend, peaking in 2013 before falling drastically in 2014. This decline may be due to several factors, including a shift in customer preference from resellers to the company’s website and a possible shortage of stock. The tables show that the 2014 data only includes January and February, which partly explains the lower numbers, but even then, those months had significantly fewer orders compared to previous years.

One key observation is that no bikes were ordered in 2014, suggesting a stock issue. Given the steady growth in orders leading up to 2013, the drop is unlikely due to pricing, delivery, or quality issues. It is more likely due to insufficient stock, possibly caused by inaccurate inventory records or poor sales forecasting. To address this, the company should improve inventory management and enhance forecasting systems to avoid future stockouts and maintain consistent sales growth.

3. Amount of profit or loss report

This report analyzes the cost and earnings of Giant Bike Company from 2010 to 2014. The total cost—including tax, freight, and product cost—amounted to RM 108.79 million, which is slightly lower than the total sales of RM 109.81 million. This indicates the company made a profit overall during the period.

A 100% stacked bar chart comparing yearly costs and sales shows that while the company earned a profit, the margin was very slim, suggesting financial health concerns. In some years, the company barely broke even. To improve profitability, it is recommended that the company consider raising product prices, especially if profit margins remain low. Another stacked bar chart breaks down cost and revenue by sales region. It shows that regions like Australia, the UK, France, and Germany generated more revenue than cost, indicating profitability. In contrast, other regions may be operating at a loss, and adjusting pricing in those areas could help balance the company’s overall financial performance. Data for 2014 is not fully representative due to unusually low order volume and is therefore excluded from profitability evaluations.

4. Customer Report

The customer report is to identify the main customer groups of Giant Bike Company. The data shows that gender and marital status have little impact on purchasing behavior, as both male and female customers—and both single and married individuals—buy bikes at similar rates. However, families with 0–2 children are more likely to purchase bikes, while those with more children are less likely to do so, possibly due to affordability concerns.

Additionally, higher-income individuals are less represented among bike owners, suggesting they may not see standard bikes as appealing. To address this, the company could introduce family-oriented promotions to attract more buyers with children and increase brand awareness. For higher-income customers, launching exclusive or limited-edition products may help tap into their preferences and boost sales in that segment.
